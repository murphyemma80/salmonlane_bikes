The Bikes of Salmon Lane

This is my first project using Python for analysis.
I wanted to combine with Microsoft SQL Server, which I was already familiar with.
I picked a fairly small dataset (around 8000 rows), for a simple concept I could easily relate to.
I selected data on a bikeshare scheme in London.

My objective was to explore how Python can be used in conjunction with SQL, and to explore data transformation with Pandas, as well as do some basic plotting.
I also learned about presentation, combining text elements in the notebook for ease of understanding of the reader.

My takeaways were that Python is incredibly versatile, and there's often many different ways of achieving the same outcome.
There's a wealth of online resources, particularly Stack Overflow was very useful.  I've listed some of my sources below.

This project helped to familiarise myself with Python syntax and online resources.  I am keen to explore further in future projects - there's a lot to learn about plotting (for example - can one combine two boxplots in one plot to keep the same axis scale?).  Also I suspect there must be a more efficient way to display a table of the histogram bins and frequencies.  
I would like to attempt to work with PostgreSQL on a future project.
